# Zebra-table
##Authors: Cris Dalessio
###Description: 
This program is a simple application that displays my timetable and highlights the entire column as well as individual rows depending on where the mouse is hovering.
We set up a hover event listener on the page and assign the hover event function to change the background color of the column and row upon detection of the mouse hovering. There is no need to use javascript in this file. Its as simple as assigning a :hover event in our css to which ever tags we want to manipulate upon hovering on :)
###Instructions:
1. Open the webpage
2. Hover mouse over multiple columns and rows
3. watch hover event in action!
