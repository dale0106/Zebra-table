# Zebra-table
##Authors: Cris Dalessio
###Description: 
This program is a simple application that displays my timetable and highlights the entire column as well as individual rows depending on where the mouse is hovering.
There is no need to use javascript in this file. Its as simple as assigning a :hover event in our css to which ever tags we want to manipulate upon hovering on :) Inside this :hover selector, we place the background colors we wish to see upon hovering on the table
###Instructions:
1. Open the webpage
2. Hover mouse over multiple columns and rows
3. watch hover event in action!
